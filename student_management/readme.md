What We Have Completed So Far

Backend (Django + DRF)

Models for Student, Course, Department.

Serializers for all three models.

API ViewSets with CRUD operations using ModelViewSet.

Populated initial course/department data.

API endpoints are accessible via /api/students/, /api/courses/, /api/departments/.

Frontend (home.html)

Display students in a table with department and course names.

Form to add new students.

Dynamic dropdowns for courses and departments.

Edit and Delete functionality with a modal for editing.

Toast messages for success/failure actions.

Proper alignment of buttons and modal.

CSRF protection and fetch API integration.

‚ö†Ô∏è Current Gaps / Issues

Department update not working properly (frontend selects department but backend may not save the correct value).

Authentication and Authorization are missing (anyone can add/update/delete).

Validation is basic ‚Äî no uniqueness check on email, no relation validation between department and course.

Pagination, Filtering, Searching are not implemented.

Tests (unit/API tests) are not written.

Deployment-ready configurations not done yet.

üöÄ Where to Start Next

Ensure serializer sends the correct foreign key IDs.

Confirm backend is updating the correct fields.

Add Authentication

Decide whether to use Django User or custom user.

Improve Serializers

Show department_name and course_name automatically in student API.

Add validation for uniqueness (email) and correct FK relation.

Optional Features

Pagination, filtering, search in DRF.

Add unit tests.

Deployment (Docker + Heroku/AWS).

‚úÖ Summary:
You have basic CRUD and frontend integration completed, including edit/delete with modal and toast messages.
Next, we fix the department update issue and add authentication & validation to make it production-ready for backend job expectations.

Tomorrow‚Äôs Plan: Completing Frontend Edit & Polish
1Ô∏è‚É£ Fix Edit/Update Functionality

2Ô∏è‚É£ Refine UI/UX

Add hover effects and responsive design tweaks if needed.

Make the toast message more visible and consistent for add, update, and delete actions.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Improve Department & Course Handling

Make the dropdowns dynamic from API (instead of hardcoded options), so future additions reflect automatically.

Ensure the student table always shows correct department/course names instead of IDs.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Optional Enhancements

Add search/filter functionality for the student table.

Add pagination if the number of students grows.

Implement inline editing or a better modal experience.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Testing

Add multiple students and test:

Add ‚Üí Should reflect in table with correct dept/course names.

Edit ‚Üí All fields including department/course update correctly.
